                    <h2>How to play</h2>
                    Default keybinds are Left mouse and Right mouse buttons, and Z and X. You can modify both in the settings.
                    Hit circles appear as the song plays. Click on the next hit circle when the approach circle closes in on it.
                    For sliders, press and hold and move along the slider at its predetermined speed.
                    Spinners are simple. Just press and hold and spin your mouse around the center as fast as you can.

                <div class="faqentry">
                    <h2>There is a lot of input lag or delay</h2>
                    Try enabling "Raw input" in the settings. However, some operating systems and browsers have their own quirks that may add more input delay.
                </div>
                <div class="faqentry">
        			<h2>Gameplay is too laggy</h2>
					Unchecking "Use system resolution" in the settings and choosing a smaller resolution than your system scaling may help with your FPS (Computers with high resolution screens may have scaling over 100%). To avoid high CPU usage, close out any other running programs and browser tabs. A restart may help, too. Make sure to use Chrome or Firefox. If you're still having problems, submit an <a href="https://github.com/111116/osu">Êèêissue</a>.

                    <h2>Nothing is loading on the web page</h2>
                    Something may be broken behind the scenes. Please contact your local, neighborhood friendly Fox for further assistance.

                    <h2>I see a lot of download pop ups (IDM)</h2>
                    This site uses XHR to load audio and video resources. Please set the downloader (IDM) to be disabled on this site.

                    <h2>Can I load local beatmap files?</h2>
                    Feature is still under development. Check back never for new updates... :)

                <div class="faqentry">
                    <h2>Audio/Video is out of sync</h2>
                    Feel free to tell a stray dog on the street about any issues you may encounter. I won't be able to fix it, sadly.

                    <h2>Other issues</h2>
                    Again... just tell Fox to help. Most problems cannot be fixed.
